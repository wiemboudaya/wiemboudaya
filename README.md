### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Wiem Boudaya, a passionate Data Scientist specializing in Biomedical Data Analysis. With a solid foundation in biophysics and medical imaging, Iâ€™ve seamlessly blended my biomedical engineering expertise with an avid interest in data science.

My journey in data analysis has been marked by an array of experiences, from optimizing patient care with data-driven solutions at ISIS MEDICAL PARIS to co-leading a bioinformatics project on breast cancer. Each role has honed my ability to analyze complex data and apply machine learning techniques, especially in the medical field.

I am particularly proud of my time as a Founder and CEO, where I directed a healthcare provider through innovative, data-informed strategies during challenging times. My experience in medical imaging has been the cornerstone of my approach to data science, allowing me to bring a unique perspective to the analysis of biomedical data.

Motivated, analytical, and ready for interdisciplinary challenges, I am eager to continue exploring innovative solutions in data science. Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can drive forward the world of healthcare and technology together!
